# Comments

* When writing code in Python, it's essential to ensure that your code can be easily understood by others, say by your friend who wants to see your code.
* Python ignores everything after the hash mark and up to the end of the line. You can insert them anywhere in your code!
* A shortcut for converting multiple lines into comments is by selecting all those lines and pressing "CTRL + /".
