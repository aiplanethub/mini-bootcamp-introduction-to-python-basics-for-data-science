# Variables

* A variable can be considered as a storage container for data.

* Every variable will have a name.

* It is a good way to store information while making it easy to refer to that information in our code later.

* For instance, instead of working with the number 3.14, we can assign it to a variable pi and use it as many times as we want in our code (wherever required).

* The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

* The syntax for assigning values to a variable is as follows: Variable name = value or information.

* Example: 
  * x = 5 
  * y = "John"
