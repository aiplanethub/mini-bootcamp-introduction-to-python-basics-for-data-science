# Operators

* Operators perform simple operations such as additions, comparisons, etc., on variables and values.
* Python supports the following types of operators; we will look at some commonly used operators in this tutorial.

## Arithmetic Operators

Using Python, we can perform some basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

Example: \
`x = 2` \
`y = 3` \
`x + y` (addition) \
`x * y`  (multiplication)
