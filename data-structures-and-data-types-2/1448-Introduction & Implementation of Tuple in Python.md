# Tuples in Python

* Tuple is also an ordered sequence of items as List. Tuple also holds multiple data types.
* The only difference in Tuple & List is that Tuple is immutable; once created it cannot be changed.

* Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values within round brackets.

* Example: A = (‘Brush’, ‘Leuven’, 48851964400, 3.14, ‘Mom’)

**Note:** The tutor in this video used python console. Nothing to worry here, you can use the same code and run it on jupyter notebook too.
