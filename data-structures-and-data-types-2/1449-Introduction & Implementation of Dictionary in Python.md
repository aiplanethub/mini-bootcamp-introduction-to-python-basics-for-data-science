# Dictionaries in Python

* Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
* Real word dictionaries are an excellent analogy for understanding them: they contain a list of key-value pairs: each pair has a key(the word) and a value(the word's meaning).

* It is generally used when we have a huge amount of data.
* It is defined within braces with each item being in the form of key: value pair. Syntax â€“ \
 `my_dict = {`\
  `"key1":"value1",`\
  `"key2":"value2",`\
  `}`

* The **keys in a dictionary must always be unique and immutable.** This is why dictionary keys can be strings but not lists.

* On the other hand, values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated.

* **Dictionary keys are case sensitive**; keys with the same name but different cases will be treated distinctly. E.g., "Ralph" and "RALPH" will be considered as two different keys.
