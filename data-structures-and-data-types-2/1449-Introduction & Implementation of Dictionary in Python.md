# Dictionaries in Python

* Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
* Real word dictionaries are a good analogy to understand them: they contain a list of items(words), each item has a key(the word) and a value(the word’s meaning).

* It generally is used when we have a huge amount of data.
* It is defined within braces with each item being in the form of key: value pair. Syntax – \
 `my_dict = {`\
  `"key1":"value1",`\
  `"key2":"value2",`\
  `}`

* The keys in a dictionary must always be unique and immutable. This is the reason dictionary keys can be String but not List.

* On the other hand, Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated.

* Dictionary keys are case sensitive, same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly.
