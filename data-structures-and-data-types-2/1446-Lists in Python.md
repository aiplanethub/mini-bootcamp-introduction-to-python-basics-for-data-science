# Lists in Python

* **List is an ordered sequence of data.** In real life, if you could make a list of things that come to your mind (or event for any specific purpose), it could be something like this –
  * Brush
  * Leuven
  * 48851964400
  * 3.14
  * Mom

* Well, this is my list. You could make your own list & include whatever you want in it. So, in my list, I have included what I do early in the morning, my city, my mobile number, the value of pi to two digits, and mom. It has different types of data – strings, float, and integer. 
* This is the kind of flexibility Python list provides. **It can hold elements of different data types.** Declaring a list is fairly straightforward. You use square brackets ([]) and separate the items by a comma. Let me write an example: \
  **`A = ["Brush", "Leuven", 48851964400, 3.14, "Mom"]`**
* **Lists are mutable.** Say if you want to change some item on a list, you can do that. For example, if I don’t like ‘Brush’ and want to replace this with ‘Morning Walk’, I can do it: \
  **`A = ["Morning Walk", "Leuven", 48851964400, 3.14, "Mom"]`**
* Some **essential features** of Python lists are:
  * Collection of values
  * Can be of any data type
  * Can be a combination of different types

**Note:** The tutor in this video used a Python console. Nothing to worry about here; you can also run the same code on a Jupyter notebook.
