# Tuples in Python

* Like a list, a tuple is an ordered sequence of items. Tuple also holds multiple data types.
* The only difference between tuple & list is that tuple is immutable; once created, it cannot be changed.

* Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values within round brackets.

* Example: **`A = (‘Brush’, ‘Leuven’, 48851964400, 3.14, ‘Mom’)`**

**Note:** The tutor in this video used a Python console. Nothing to worry about here; you can also run the same code in a Jupyter notebook.
