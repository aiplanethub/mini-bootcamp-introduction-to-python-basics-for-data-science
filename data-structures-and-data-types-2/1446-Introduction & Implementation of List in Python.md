# Lists in Python

* As the name suggests, **List is an ordered sequence of data. In real life, if you could make a list of things that come to your mind** (or event for any specific purpose), it could be something like this –
  * Brush
  * Leuven
  * 48851964400
  * 3.14
  * Mom

* **Well, this is my list. You could make your own list & include whatever you want in it.** So, in my list, I have included what I do early in the morning, the city I live in, my mobile number, the value of pi to two digits, and mom. It has different types of data – strings, float, and integer. 

* **Well, this is the kind of flexibility Python List provides. It can hold elements of different data types. Declaring a List is fairly straightforward. You use square bracket (\[]) and separate the items by a comma.** Let me write an example - \
  A = \["Brush", "Leuven", 48851964400, 3.14, "Mom"]

* **Lists are mutable.** Say if you want to change some item on a List, you can do that. For example, if I don’t like  ‘Brush’’, and want to replace this with ‘Morning Walk’, I can do it –
  \
  A = \["Morning Walk", "Leuven", 48851964400, 3.14, "Mom"] 
* Some **essential features** of Python lists are:
  * Collection of values
  * Can be of any data type
  * Can be a combination of different types

**Note:** The tutor in this video used python console. Nothing to worry here, you can use the same code and run it on Jupyter notebook too.
