## Why Python for Data Science?

* Free and open source
* Great community
* Plenty of libraries for Data Science & Machine Learning
* Easy and intuitive to use

**Note:**

* Data Science is not about programming languages/tools such as Python, R, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, etc
* Data Science is about using the above tools and techniques, and, if required, inventing new tools and techniques, to solve a problem using “data” in a “scientific” way.
