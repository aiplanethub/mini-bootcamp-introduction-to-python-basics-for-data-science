# What is Google Colab?

Now that we know the importance of Python in Data Science, let's try to understand the tools that we need to use to run Python for Data Science tasks.

One of the popular toolkits that data scientists use to run their Python scripts is an interactive notebook. There are various ways in which you can setup an interactive notebook. In this module, we will learn one them, i.e., how to setup and use Google Colab.

### What are Interactive Notebooks?

* We are humans and always need user-friendly applications. Notebooks are typically used by data scientists for quick exploration tasks and easy-to-use interactive data science environments.

### Google Colab - Online Environment to Run Python Code

  * Google colab is the simplest way to setup an interactive notebook environment to perform your data science tasks.
  * The environment offers you up to 12 GB RAM/GPU etc for free and 100 GB storage.
  * You donâ€™t need to worry about installing a bulky python application on your laptop/computer

In case you are opening the video on YouTube, you may _**start from 24 secs and watch till 3 mins 10 secs**_ (rest will be covered later)

There seems to some issue with visibility in the video with print function. Print function is usually used as follows print(z)  However, in the video it appears to be print.(z). due to screen recording  issue, so please use the correct one, i.e., print(z).
