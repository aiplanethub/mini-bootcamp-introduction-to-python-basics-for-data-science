# What is Google Colab?

Now that we know the importance of Python in Data Science, let's try to understand the tools we need to use to run Python for Data Science tasks.

An interactive notebook is one of the popular toolkits that data scientists use to run their Python scripts. There are various ways in which you can set up an interactive notebook. In this module, we will learn one of them, i.e., how to set up and use Google Colab.

## What are Interactive Notebooks?

* We are humans and always need user-friendly applications. Data scientists typically use notebooks for quick exploration tasks and easy-to-use interactive data science environments.

## Google Colab - Online Environment to Run Python Code

  * Google Colab is the simplest way to set up an interactive notebook environment to perform your data science tasks.
  * The environment offers you up to 12 GB RAM and a GPU for free and 100 GB storage.
  * You don't need to worry about installing a bulky Python application on your laptop/computer.

## Getting Started Video to Run Python Code on Colab

In case you are opening the video on YouTube, you may _**start from 24 secs and watch till 3 mins 10 secs**_ (rest will be covered later)

There seems to be some issue with visibility in the video with the print function. The print function is usually used as `print(z)`. However, in the video, it appears to be `print.(z)` due to a screen recording issue. Please use the correct one, i.e., `print(z)`.
