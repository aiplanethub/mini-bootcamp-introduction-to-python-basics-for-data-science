# Methods

* In Python, everything is an object (be it a list, string, int, etc.).

* A method in Python is somewhat similar to a function; the only difference is that a method depends on the object while a function is independent of the object.

* Can you recall we had used len() in the earlier modules? Well, this is a function. We can use len() on lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, etc., to get the number of elements in them. 
* In comparison, append() is a **method** associated with lists only. You cannot use the append() method on tuples, strings, or dictionaries. It is related to the list data type only.

* Different Python objects have different methods associated with them (depending on the type of the object).
