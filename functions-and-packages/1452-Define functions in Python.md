# Define Functions

* In Python a function is defined using the **def keyword.**
* In the next tutorial, we will be learning:
  * How to write a function
  * How to call a function - Of course, if we have created a function, we need to use it somewhere by calling it right? ;)
  * We will also learn how to write a function that would convert bitcoin into USD :P

* Note: The tutor used some other user-friendly local Python IDE (similar to  Colab or Jupyter notebook), so donâ€™t press the panic button looking at the new coding interface.  You can comfortably run the same code on colab/jupyter notebook (or any python environment) and it will work.
