# sum() and round() functions

## round()

* Round function in python rounds off the decimal value of a number to its nearest integer. For example: round(65.66) = 66.
* In addition, one can input the specified number of decimals to which the number should be rounded off. For example: round(65.66, 1) = 65.7.
* Its syntax is: `round(number, ndigits)`:
  - **number** - the number to be rounded.
  - **ndigits** - number of decimal places up to which the given number is rounded; defaults to 0.
