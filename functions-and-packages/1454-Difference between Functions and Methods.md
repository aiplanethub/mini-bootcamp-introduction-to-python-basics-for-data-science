# Functions and Methods: Are they the Same?

* You might have a question: "Why on Earth do we have both functions and methods when they practically do the same thing?"

* Firstly, let's start with the obvious. There is a clear difference in the syntax:
  * A function looks like this: `function(something)`
  * And a method looks like this: `something.method()`

* Namely: a method always belongs to an object (e.g., in the x.index(2) method, .index() needed the x object to be applicable), while a function doesn't necessarily depend on a Python object.

* All methods are functions, but not all functions are methods!

* If this makes no sense to you (yet), don't you worry. I promise the idea will grow on you as you use Python more and more – especially when you start to define your own functions and methods.
