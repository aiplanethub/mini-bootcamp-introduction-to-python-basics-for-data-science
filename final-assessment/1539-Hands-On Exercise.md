# Hands-On Exercise

Your final score in this bootcamp will be a combination of three components: 20 marks for the quiz, 60 marks from the peer review of your project submission, and 20 marks for reviewing three notebooks from your peers.

The questions/tasks for the project will be uploaded as an AI Challenge on the DPhi website itself. You can find a list of active AI Challenges here: https://dphi.tech/challenges/#active.

Don't worry if you don't see a Challenge for this bootcamp in the first few days - we will release them soon. In the meantime, make sure you go through all the material of the Bootcamp and attempt the quiz. 

Once the deadline for project submission (25th July 18:29 GMT) has passed, the next step is to review the work of three of your peers. You will receive the notebooks to be reviewed through E-mail. Evaluate them using the scoring document (also provided in the e-mail), then submit your peer review in the form given below. Finishing your peer review constitutes 20% of your final grade.

Form for submitting your peer review: TBA

Note: Only those who submit their own project will be considered for reviewing others' work.
